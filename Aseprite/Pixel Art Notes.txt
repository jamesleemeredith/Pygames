Screen Size and Aspect Ratio:
320x180 - 8-16-bit style games
640x360 - Hi-bit style games
Screen aspect ratio most commonly 16:9 at 1920 by 1080p

Character Canvas Size:
16x16 - characters similar to 8-Bit era games
32x32 - SNES-like characters aka 16-bit
64+   - High detail characters (requires significant time commitment)

Tile Canvas Size:
typically .5-1x the size of a character. Larger tyles make the game look more "blocky", whereas smaller tiles allow for more intricate level design


Scale:
Player character typically 10%-20% of total screen size
Consider the style of game and the demands of view distance that might result (ex. a platforming intense game will want smaller characters and tiles to maximize the amount of things that can be shown on the screen in order to allow for greater map complexity)


Detail:
Don't think every inch of the screen needs to be filled with detail, think WHERE the detail needs to be
