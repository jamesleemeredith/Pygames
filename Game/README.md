## Introduction

The **Phantom Ninja Game** is a simple yet captivating 2D game where you control a phantom ninja character with fluid movements and exciting animations. This project serves as a great example of game development using Pygame, showcasing how to handle character animations, movements, and interactions within a game environment.

Our phantom ninja character has an idle animation, can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and shoot fireballs in the direction it is facing. This project aims to demonstrate the basics of game mechanics, sprite handling, and animation in Python using Pygame.

## Features

- **Character Movement:** Move the phantom ninja character using the W, A, S, D keys.
- **Fireball Shooting:** Shoot fireballs by clicking the left mouse button.
- **Idle Animation:** The phantom ninja has a three-frame idle animation that makes it look alive even when stationary.
- **Direction-Based Shooting:** Fireballs are shot in the direction the character is facing.
